# Basketball-Bracket-Game
Intermediate Python Program

This is a very intermidiate python terminal game, the rules are simple though | Pick 8 players to duke it out. Out of those 8, 4 will progress. Those 4 will battle,
2 will progress. Those 2 will battle and then you have your champ. I organized each bracket into 3 different classes, winners, victors and champ. You will end up
with 4 winners, 2 victors, and 1 champ. | Also, the tie breaker is a coin flip | ALL CODE IS MADE BY ME yet the idea came from ForrestKnight |
